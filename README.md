# Brain Tumor Detection
  ***Project Description***
  
    Developed a deep learning model for the detection and classification of brain tumors from medical imaging data.
  
  ***Technologies Used***
  
    LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), SEBlock (Squeeze-and-Excitation Block), Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping).
  
  ***Responsibilities***
  
    Implemented LSTM for accurate classification of brain tumor types.
    Utilized CNN for effective feature extraction from medical images.
    Integrated SEBlock to enhance the representational power of the neural network.
    Applied Grad-CAM for explainable AI (XAI), providing visual explanations for model predictions.
    
  ***Achievements***
  
    Achieved high accuracy in tumor detection and classification.
    Improved model interpretability with Grad-CAM, aiding in better understanding of the decision-making process.
